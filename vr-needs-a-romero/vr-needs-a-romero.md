Jeff Atwood's blog post, [The Road to VR](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2014/02/the-road-to-vr.html), neatly summarizes a bunch of conversations I've had recently after receiving my Oculus dev kit. 

*"If nothing else, it is abundantly clear that even after all these years, VR presents deep, hairy technical challenges even on today's insanely fast, crazily powerful hardware. That's exactly the sort of problem suited to the off-the-charts skill level of legendary programmers like Abrash and [Carmack](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_D._Carmack). Having both of these guys working on the newest Oculus Rift prototype with an enthusiasm I haven't felt since the early 90's means we could be on the verge of a Doom or Quake style killer app breakthrough in VR."* ([The Road to VR](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2014/02/the-road-to-vr.html))

I especially love the [Dactyl Nightmare](http://vr.wikinet.org/wiki/Dactyl_Nightmare) reference :P

I work at a 3d printing company ([Shapeways](http://www.shapeways.com)) and we are constantly having similar discussions: 'when will 3d printing be ready for mainstream adoption?' What I've realized is that 'mainstream adoption,' or in other words, the tech being ready, is entirely application-specific.

For example, we have people making [UAV/drone landing gear](https://www.shapeways.com/model/1075118/simensays-foldable-landing-gear-for-dji-phantom.html?li=productGroup&materialId=62) out of nylon-based plastic. For those users, the 3D printed part is everything they want: light, flexible but strong, and inexpensive. Others, like action figure makers, feel that the plastic is not smooth enough to rival injection molding, isn't watertight, and most likely is not safe if a kid puts it in their mouth.

I use these examples because I believe they're incredibly applicable to VR. When I first strapped on my Rift and loaded up Riftcoaster, I was expecting graphics comparable to 640x480 GLQuake. Instead, I got sub-300x200 and was quite disappointed. I tried a variety of games and had a similar experience - something just felt 'off' and my brain couldn't get into it.

However, there was one game that blew me away. It wasn't a big-budget shooter, or even one of the more highly rated rift demos. It was [Rift Racer](http://www.decane.net/game/oculus-rift/riftracer/), an incredibly low-poly racing game that loosely resembled the old game 'Stunts' that made rounds in the msdos shareware days.

What this game nailed was a combo of graphics that were simple enough to appear 'normal' within this low-res world, controls that felt smooth, and above all else: absolutely perfect head tracking. It's crazy how much of a difference being able to look slightly left makes when taking a left hand turn... Or the moment when you're launched up in the air from a huge ramp and look behind you to see the ground as it quickly approaches.

These decisions I just described design problems, not feats of engineering. are not technical challenges, they're design decisions. We're talking about making something 'feel' real.

Abrash constantly refers to 'immersion' and this demo made me understand why. Some percentage of aspects of the world around you must feel 'real' in order for your brain to believe the trick.

The real question is... Who is VR's [John Romero](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Romero)? Who will be the designer with the vision to compliment Carmack and Abrash?

The same designer/engineering balance described in [Masters of Doom](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masters_of_Doom) needs to take place again, or else we'll end up with clunky, high-tech systems that don't feel human. At Shapeways, we pair materials with specific product categories to produce a great product with our current technology. The same pairing of great games with the right graphics, controls, and mechanics need to be designed for VR to be a success.
